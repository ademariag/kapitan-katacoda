# Kapitan command line

***kapitan*** is essentially a tool to template files. Things can be anything like a text file, a script, a yaml/json manifest. It was created to manage Kubernetes based deployments but it is flexible enough to be used in completely different contexts.

Let's start by downloading an example environment:

`git clone https://github.com/ademariag/kapitan-examples --depth 1`{{execute}}
`cd kapitan-examples/example-3/`{{execute}}
