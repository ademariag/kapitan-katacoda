# Kapitan command line

***kapitan*** is a tool we have created to help manage Kubernetes deployment. The tool is flexiable and generic so that it can be adapted to more tasks than just Kubernete.

***kapitan*** is essentially a tool to compile multiple templates (***`jinja`*** or ***`jsonnet`***) using the ***`inventory`*** as a Single Source of Truth.

Start by running `kapitan`{{execute}}  and familiarize with the help output.
