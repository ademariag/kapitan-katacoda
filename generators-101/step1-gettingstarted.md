 Clone the example repository
Let's get started by cloning the Kapitan Reference repository

`git clone https://github.com/kapicorp/kapitan-reference.git kapitan-reference && cd kapitan-reference`{{execute}}

Run `./kapitan --version`{{execute}} to check what version you are running. Check on https://kapitan.dev to see if a new version has been released and to find more documentation.

Run `./kapitan compile`{{execute}} to compile all the other examples already present in this repository.

As you can see, this reference repository comes already pre-installed with a good amount of examples, which you can see being compiled by Kapitan
