Let's get started by cloning the Kapitan Reference repository

`git clone https://github.com/kapicorp/kapitan-reference.git && cd kapitan-reference`{{execute}}

Run `./kapitan compile`{{execute}} to make sure that everything is working ok

> **Note**: this might take some time while the docker image gets downloaded
